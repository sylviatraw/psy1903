## Description

The project leads users through a prime, which is either a story about a gender queer & sexually queer person struggling with their mental health, the same story but with a cis/straight person, and the same story but where the person's gender and sexuality are unspecified. 

Then, the users will complete an IAT where the target categories are LGBTQ+ and Cishet and the attribute categories are mental illness and physical illness. They will complete trials sorting words into the target categories and trials sorting words into the attribute categories, then they will complete combined trials.

Lastly, the participants will complete a questionnaire, which, for this experiment, is the Heteronormative Attitudes and Beliefs scale (Habarth, 2013), before being directed to the debrief screen.
